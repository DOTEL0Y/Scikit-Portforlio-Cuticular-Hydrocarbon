## Introduction
With the assistance of GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass spectrometry), an instrument to identify the structure of molecular components was utilized to quantify key molecules typically present in Honeybee queenâ€™s cuticle. These molecules consist of cuticular hydrocarbon (chc) and lipids or esters. These chc and lipids are responsible for crucial biological functionality within queen bees and are indicators to fertility and stressors.  With a dataset reflective of five diets concerning human impacts on nature; the goal was to construct a machine-learning model that would be effective in identifying the diet/treatment of a queen bee. For reference of the treatment groups look at figure 1. At first, the algorithm ADABOOST was used, and unsatisfactory accuracy shed some light on the issues of the dataset. Analyzing the data and its properties was crucial for success.
